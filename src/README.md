# Java Portfolio
A place to find all of my personal Java projects.

The Algorithmic directory contains single-file projects (an entire project is contained in each file), whereas any other directory will be for a whole project itself, such as Circus.

The CustomLibrary is a library I created for any potential code reuse in my projects, including data structures (e.g. AVL tree) and JavaFX objects (e.g. a popup prompt).

This is the IntelliJ project I work in (hence the settings files).

If you have any questions or would like to report any bugs, please let me know at jacksluong@gmail.com.
