# Java Portfolio
A place to find all of my personal Java projects.

The Algorithmic directory contains single-file projects (an entire project is contained in each file), whereas any other directory will be for a whole project itself, such as Circus.

The CustomLibrary is a library I created for any potential code reuse in my projects, including data structures (e.g. AVL tree) and JavaFX objects (e.g. a popup prompt).

Downloading everything in one file likely won't work right when opened in an IDE (because CustomLibrary was a separate project that I used as a global library in IntelliJ, so not all of this was part of the same project) and may require some moving around before (the import statements start) functioning properly.

If you have any questions or would like to report any bugs, please let me know at jacksluong@gmail.com.
