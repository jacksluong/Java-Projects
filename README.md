# Java Portfolio
A place to find all of my personal Java projects.

The subfolders DataStructure, JavaFX, and Other contain the contents of my custom-made library created for any potential code reuse in my projects, including data structures (e.g. AVL tree) and JavaFX objects (e.g. a popup prompt). It is used as a dependency in the IntelliJ project, but for the lack of my ability to add dependencies to this repository, I have manually added the files in the src folder.

The Algorithmic subfolder contains single-file projects (an entire project is contained in each file), whereas any other subfolder will be for a whole project itself, such as Circus.

If you have any questions or would like to report any bugs, please let me know at jacksluong@gmail.com.
